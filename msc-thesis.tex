\chapter{Context}
Since invention of the World Wide Web, the number of its users increased rapidly. Today, more than 90 percent of the German population use the internet \cite{Onlinestudie}. Enterprises and organizations, recognised this potential to provide their services to a large number of people as Service Providers (SP). A frequently used method of SPs is "online self-service" (OSS). Specialized software tools enable customers to use services through the internet without direct human interaction.

Many tools require identification of a user in case interactions or initiated business processes have to be associated with him. An identity provider (IdP) who stores partial identities of users therefore is part of numerous system architectures. This leads to customers of SPs to be associated with multiple partial identities - one for each SP. Service Providers usually enable users to manage their partial identities using online self-service through so called User Profiles.

The issues of this approach becomes clear for a large amount of partial identities. The more Service Providers a person is customer of, the more partial identities he will have to manage through user profiles. Changing the home address in each profile becomes a major inconvenience. More serious problems occur for example through the increased risk of data breaches.

An improved model for identity management is necessary. In recent years, multiple new models have been invented. One model called Social Login became popular. It enables customers to leverage existing User Profiles of social networks like Facebook to create new User Profiles for Service Providers. This improves identity management by enabling SPs to rely on the identity information they are provided by the external profile. Users can manage identity related information through their Social Profile and each change would then be propagated to User Profiles of connected SPs.

This approach, however, still leaves the requirement of User Profiles for each SP because depending on the provided service, additional attributes which are not part of the Social Profile, have to be manageable by the user. This includes for example subscriptions or contracts.

The solution to this problem is an Identity Management System (IMS) which manages the whole online identity of a person and can replace the individual partial identities and User Profiles. The system itself is provided and hosted by a SP for consumption by other SPs. To replace existing User Profiles, the IMS can not only rely on systems for registration, authentication, authorisation and provisioning. Additional requirements of SPs like communication, data wallet and management of additional attributes have to be satisfied.

In order for an SP to use identities and services of an IMS, an integration into the system architecture of the SP has to take place. Due to the complex nature of system architectures and identity management, this is a difficult task.

A currently relevant example for usage of online self-service with particular interesting requirements for identities is the "Online Access Law" (OZG). It requires all administrative services of the German federal republic, each member state and commune to be digitally available through interoperable user profiles. The current plan is to make the profiles only available for usage in context of the OZG. From a user perspective, this would be yet another partial identity and user profile to manage.

\chapter{Objective}
Based on the prominent example of the OZG, the bachelor thesis will construct a message based integration architecture which enables system architectures of service providers with existing user profiles to make their services usable with an Identity Management System. In order to make the integration architecture suitable to real life requirements, the OZG is selected as an example due to its current relevance and high requirements regarding identity management. The integration architecture is however not only applicable in cases relevant for OZG but also for other Service Providers with similar requirements. As requirements of SPs are not guaranteed to be similar to those of the OZG, the integration architecture is built to be expendable.

The \textbf{integration architecture} for the OZG enables the \textbf{IMS functionalities} to be usable for selected \textbf{OZG scenarios} by integrating a \textbf{connector} in the \textbf{system architecture} of a member state.

\begin{itemize}
    \item OZG scenarios are based on documented digitalization efforts of administrative services in the context of the OZG and are for example be the application for an administrative service or the communication with a governmental institution.
    \item The system architecture is based on documentation about architecture plans of member states.
    \item The functionalities of the IMS are based on a requirements analysis of OZG scenarios and additional research.
    \item The connector is defined based on functionalities the integration architecture requires from the IMS.
    \item The integration architecture is the main scientific contribution of this bachelor thesis. It is based on messaging patterns in order to utilize a combination of established and tested messaging solutions. In order to save investments it also reuses as many system components as possible and modifies as few system components as necessary.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Structure of Work}
In the beginning of the thesis, basic concepts and terminology is explained on which the following chapters will rely.

Then, preparatory work relevant for the integration architecture is presented.
Based on process diagrams of digitalized administration services, several use cases of OSS are listed and evaluated for their relevance. They provide important information on which functionalities the IMS is required to have and the integration architecture is required to integrate.

An integration approach through a connector is used. Concrete functionalities and interfaces of a possible connector are specified for usage by the integration architecture.

Based on documentation of system architectures of several member states, relevant components of the architecture relevant for the OZG are selected. Each component is explained in detail along with the functionalities it provides for usage by the integration architecture.

The integration architecture integrates previously documented connector and components of the system architecture in order to make the selected OSS cases usable with the IMS. The architecture is presented iteratively. Each iteration contains increasingly demanding requirements along with the documentation of the increasingly complex integration architecture. Each documentation is done through textual explanations, multiple flow diagrams and one messaging architecture.

In order to validate the integration architecture, the execution of one administration service with usage of the IMS is evaluated in theory.

\chapter{Fundamentals}

This chapter defines many of the terms which were used in the previous introduction and further elaborates the underlying concepts and relevance for the objective of the bachelor thesis.

\section{Service Provider}
Service providers (SP) are entities like enterprises or organisations which make services accessible over the internet.

\section{Online Self-Service}
Online self-service (OSS) describes a method used by Service Providers to make their services available to the user. The method is characterized by being available over the internet, requiring no direct human interaction but instead enabling the user to access services in a self-reliant way. The user is usually supported by a variety of software solutions.

\section{Self-Service Tools}
Self-service tools are software solutions for customers to enable a online self-service experience. Depending on the use case, the tools can be transactional or informing. Informing tools help users to retrieve relevant information, often replacing human customer support. Transactional tools help users to interact with services in a persistent way to for example save personal data or trigger business processes.

Information tools can be for example so called "WiKi" pages or search fields which assist the user in his process of finding information. Transactional tools can be for example online forms which assist the user in his process of triggering an order placement business process.

In contrast to information tools, transactional tools often require identification of users in order to associate them with changes they made to the system: If a user triggers the business process of ordering a product, the SP requires identification of the user.

\section{OZG}

This section introduces the law for improvement of online access of administrative services (Online Access Law - OZG), its origin, purpose and planned realization.

\subsection{Context}

The Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community is, amongst other things, responsible for modernizing public administration \cite{BMI:Moderne_Verwaltung}. Current modernization efforts lie in the construction of an E-Government \cite{BMI:Behoerdengaenge}.
The E-Government-Law in 2013 was an early step increasing internal usage of digital systems in governmental administration. This includes for example the usage of digital personal files and scanning of documents for replacement \cite{BMI:E-Government_Gesetz}. 
In 2017 the German government passed the law for improvement of online access to administrative services (OZG) which focuses on usage of administration services by the people \cite{BMI:Onlinezugangsgesetz}. 
Modernization of the administration, however, is not exclusive to Germany as in 2018 the European Parliament and Council decided on a Single Digital Gateway (SDG) providing uniform access to digital administrative governmental services of every European country \cite{BMI:Single_Digital_Gateway}.

\subsection{Motivation}

Customers on the free market are used to One-Stop-Shops providing access to services of companies in one digital place. Many self-service methods improve the user experience: Customers of e-commerce companies can put products in a digital shopping card, pay with digital money and select a location for delivery. In most cases, no direct human to human interaction is required. Customers complete the process of ordering in self-service. The progress of online self-service usage on the free market is a result of the ongoing digitalization of the world and the competitiveness of the market. Today, many customers own personal computers or smartphones and companies providing easy access to their services via online self-service have an advantage in the market.
Governmental institutions provide administrative services for customers. This can for example be an application for child benefit or a new ID card. In contrast to the free market, access to administrative services is, in most cases, not available through online self-service. Reasons are, that digitalization is expensive and governmental institutions do not have competitors.
Digitalization of governmental administration could for example enable users to inform themselves about available administrative services and access them over the internet. The need to personally appear in offices of an administration would be reduced. Communication about questions or required documents could also happen faster, more immediate, and more reliable over the internet than over mail. Governmental institutions could reduce bureaucracy through modernization of registries and the once-only principle.
The German government recognizes the possible improvements and presents, amongst other things, the OZG as a solution. \cite{IT-Planungsrat:Herausforderung}

\subsection{The OZG}

The law for improvement of online access of administrative services (Online Access Law - OZG) passed in 2017 and requires federal republic and member states to execute the following regulations until 2022 \cite{BMI:OZG_Wortlaut}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Digital availability of administrative services} \\
    An administrative service is the electronic processing of administrative procedures which are available from outside the governmental institution.  As it is not clear which administrative services exactly are meant by the definition of the OZG, the BMI created a catalogue \cite{BMI:Verwaltungsleistungen}. The OZG requires these services to be digitally available. As a guideline to what is considered sufficient availability, the BMI defined a maturity model \cite{BMI:Digitale_Services}.
    \item \textbf{Digital access to administrative services through administration portals of a portal network} \\
    Federal republic, each member state and each commune must provide an administration portal. Portals of communes must be linked to the portal of the corresponding member state. Portals of federal republic and member states must be connected through a portal network. \cite{BMI:Portalverbund} Each portal must provide a "seek and find" feature, which enables users to find all administrative services provided by any administration portal \cite{Cotar:Drucksache_19/19089}. 
    \item \textbf{Interoperable user profiles for accessing administrative services} \\
    Federal republic and member states must provide user profiles which can be used to identify the corresponding person while requesting access to administrative services, to save personal information according to the once-only principle, to receive and send messages via a digital mailbox and to pay for services \cite{Cotar:Drucksache_19/19089}. The user profiles must be interoperable for every administration portal of the portal network.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{OZG Execution}

Execution of the OZG can be separated into two projects: Digitalization and Networking. Digitalization focuses on transformation of existing processes and services to be using modern technologies. This includes most importantly the digitalization of governmental administrative services. The networking focuses on connecting existing and future governmental systems to make digitalization universally usable. This includes most importantly the construction of administration portals which are connected in a portal network.

Many services, which are still bound to paper must be digitalized. In total, the BMI lists 575 relevant services. Some of them are provided by the federal republic, some by the member states and yet other by the communes. Respective to these responsibilities, the task of digitalization is distributed between federal republic and member states, where each member state is assigned to take the lead for specific areas. \cite{BMI:Onlinezugangsgesetz} Results of the digitalization are documented on the "OZG-Informationsplattform" \cite{BMI:Informatiosplattform} as process diagrams and data schemata.

Administrative services are made available through administrative portals which are be provided by federal republic, each member state and each commune. Communes integrate their portals with corresponding member states. The portals are connected through an "Online-Gateway" and form a portal network.

Federal republic and each member state provide digital access to administrative services. An important method is called "one for all": One member state manages the digitalization of a category of administrative services and makes them digitally accessible for every other member state. Every administrative service can be found through a search function provided by every portal of the network.

Depending on the administrative service, a user profile is required to verify ones identity. As federal republic and most member states already provide their own user profiles, the "IT-Planungsrat" decided to save investments by connecting them to an interoperable user profile.

There exists a low, substantial and high level of authentication security when logging in to a user profile or when creating one.
A low trust level is for example the usage of a username and password combination, a high trust level is for example the usage of the eID feature of the German ID card. Depending on the administrative service a profile tries to access, a different trust level is required.

Profiles also enable users to save personal data in a data wallet and to communicate with institutions through an inbox.

\section{OSS Connector}

\section{OZG System Architecture}
This section describes the system architecture of a member state relevant for the execution of the OZG an integration of a OSS provider. Due to a lack of detailed information, the system architecture is described by components responsible for a category of tasks. Each component is associated to data objects it processes. The definition of components and data objects are based on research about planned system architectures of member states.

\subsection{User Profile}
Each member state provides its own user profile which manages the identity of a user. It enables him to create, delete and login to a profile, authenticate for administration services, communicate with institutions through an inbox and manage personal information and documents in a data wallet.

\subsection{Administration Portal}
The administration portal provides the user with a web-interface he can use to access his user profile and search for available administration services.

\subsection{Application Platform}
The application platform gives access to administration services by providing the user with a website he can use to fill in application forms and sent them to the responsible institutions. It is possible to prefill the form with personal data stored inside the user profile.

\subsection{Institution}
Institutions are the entities distributed all over the member state which eventually process the incoming applications and provide the users with solutions.

\chapter{Integration Architecture}

This chapter presents a message based integration architecture which enables access to OSS features of member states through a OSS provider. Multiple versions of an integration architecture are presented which fulfill increasingly complex requirements. Requirements are formulated as user scenarios which should be accomplishable through the OSS provider.
Each version is presented in the form of multiple flow charts, each describing sequential steps while carrying out a required scenario and a corresponding messaging infrastructure.

\section{Basic}

\subsection{Requirements}
In the first version of the integration architecture, users of the OSS provider should be able to
\begin{itemize}
    \item fill in an application
    \item authenticate
    \item receive and send messages
\end{itemize}
