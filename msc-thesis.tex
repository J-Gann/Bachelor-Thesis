\chapter{Context}

Since invention of the World Wide Web, the number of its users increased rapidly. Today, more than 90 percent of the German population use the Internet \cite{Onlinestudie}. Enterprises recognised this potential to inform and interact with a large number of people. Today, an often used method can be called "digital customer self-service" (DCSS). Specialized software tools enable customers to use services of an enterprise through the internet without direct human interaction.

Developing and maintaining these tools and the underlying architecture can be a difficult and expensive task. Required software solutions can therefore be accessed from commercial DCSS providers. In order to use their tools, enterprises will have to integrate them into existing system architectures. Depending on for example the complexity of the tools, different integration approaches can be applied.

Many tools require user profiles if authentication, communication or access to personal information is necessary. Systems providing profiles therefore are part of numerous enterprise architectures. This leads online customers to create multiple user profiles - one for each enterprise. It is then his responsibility to keep his profiles synchronised and up to date. Increasing numbers of user profiles lead to a variety issues: Frequent changes of credentials become unrealistic and modification of an E-Mail address becomes a major inconvenience.

An evolutionary step in customer profile management is the usage of self-sovereign identities (SSI): instead of each enterprise, the customer provides a user profile. This profile can be managed by a trusted DCSS provider for SSI. In order for this concept to work, each enterprise will have to integrate the provider into their existing user profile systems. The result would be one user profile for one person which identifies him as a customer for multiple integrated enterprises.

A currently relevant example for usage of DCSS with particular interesting requirements for user profiles is the "Online Access Law" (OZG). It requires all administrative services of the German federal republic, each member state and commune to be digitally available through interoperable user profiles. The current plan is to make the profile only available for usage in context of the OZG. From a user perspective, this would be yet another profile to manage.

\chapter{Objective}

Based on the prominent example of the OZG, the bachelor thesis will construct a message based integration architecture which enables system architectures with existing user profiles to accept SSI through its providers. 

In the beginning, the terms DCSS, DCSS provider, SSI, SSI provider, SSI connector and OZG are defined and the underlying concept is explained.

Then, preparatory work relevant for the integration architecture is presented. Based on process diagrams of digitalized administration services, several use cases of DCSS are listed and evaluated for their relevance. They provide important information on which functionalities the SSI provider is expected to have and the integration architecture is required to integrate.

As an integration approach through a connector is used, concrete functionalities and interfaces of a possible connector are specified for usage by the integration architecture.

Based on documentation of system architectures of several member states, relevant components of the architecture relevant for the OZG are selected. Each component is explained in detail along with the functionalities it provides for usage by the integration architecture.

The integration architecture integrates previously documented connector and components of the system architecture in order to make the selected use cases available through the SSI provider. Integration patterns are used to formulate the integration architecture. In order to save investments the integration reuses as many systems as possible and modifies as few systems as necessary.

The integration architecture is presented iteratively. Each iteration contains increasingly demanding requirements along with the documentation of the increasingly complex integration architecture. Each documentation is done through textual explanations, multiple flow diagrams and one messaging architecture.

In order to validate the integration architecture, the execution of one administration service through the SSI provider is evaluated in theory.

\chapter{Fundamentals}

\section{Digital Customer Self-Service}
This chapter introduces the concept of digital customer self-service. It defines DCSS, describes what it is by usage of examples and mentions benefits such as challenges.

\textbf{Definition}: Digital self-service is the consumption of services provided by an enterprise over the internet without human to human interaction.
It is important to distinguish between "service" and "self-service".
The difference is shown through two examples:

\textbf{Example 1}: A service is the availability to purchase items whereas digital self-service is the placement of orders over a website.

\textbf{Example 2}: A service is the availability of video on demand whereas digital self-service is the access of video files over a website.

Digital self-service is one of many possible ways to access a service: An order placement could also be done through email or phone call and access to videos could be granted through same-day-delivery of DVDs.

Customers are able to do digital self-service because they are provided with digital self-service tools. Creating those is not trivial and is the main business model of many companies. Video on demand websites for example do not only flourish as a result of providing access to videos (this business model existed long before them) but as a result of the digital self-service tools they provide.

There exist a lot of different use cases of DCSS. Many can be differentiated into two categories: DCSS for information and DCSS for transaction.
The category DCSS for information contains use cases where DCSS enables users to \textbf{retrieve} information relevant for them. The category DCSS for transaction contains use cases where DCSS enables users to permanently \textbf{add} information to a system, usually in order to trigger some process.

A use case for retrieving information through DCSS are so called "WiKi" pages. Similar to the famous website "Wikipedia", information about for example the usage of a product can be made accessible to customers. In this case, it is not necessary any more to call a support hot-line or visit a shop. Another example are online learning platforms which provide customers with necessary information to for example learn a language. In this case, it is not necessary any more to meet teachers. Online job hunting websites enable its users to find information about job offers which fit their requirements. In this case it is not necessary any more to go to employment bureaus.

A common use case for transaction through DCSS are online retailers which enable users to start payment and delivery processes by providing the necessary information. They are often accompanied by DCSS for information in order to find and select products. In this case it is not necessary any more to go to the local shopping mall. Another use case is the management of user identities where DCSS enables users to authenticate themselves and manage personal information. In this case it is not necessary any more to show up in person at for example a store in order to identify ones identity and give personal information about e.g. the living address.

Reasons for the widespread usage of digital self-service are significant benefits in ease of service usability for customers and cost reduction for enterprises. Customers can self-service from almost every place, easily manage customer data like phone number and address, configure services like subscription plans and access lots of information on available products or trouble shooting steps in an immediate way. Digital customer self-service improves usability, saves time, increases availability, saves money and therefore increases customer experience.
Enterprises, especially in progressive countries, aim to keep employment at a minimum, as it is a big cost factor. Digital self-service turns customers into unpaid employees.

Decreasing employment cost while increasing customer experience sounds like a win-win situation. Sadly, digital self-service does have its downsides. One downside is most immediate to the elderly. In order to use DCSS, computers have to be available and one has to be experienced in their usage. Technological complexity, however, is not only a problem for customers but also for enterprises providing DCSS. Based on existing system architectures, adding DCSS functionalities can turn out to be a difficult task. Some form of integration is often necessary. With increased system complexity and business dependability come additional maintenance cost.

As today most large enterprises provide DCSS, it can be assumed, that at a given size of an enterprise (measured in number of customers), the benefits of DCSS surpass its disadvantages.

Governments see digitalization as a chance for improvements in many important social and economical areas. The process of digitalization can in some cases be described as reinventing existing solutions for usability with computers. One of the goals is to make solutions more easily accessible for users and as a method, provide digital self-service. Governmental regulations relating to digitalization therefore often encourage or demand enterprises and organizations to provide DCSS.

\subsection{DCSS Provider}
As described in the previous section, digital customer self-service is a widely used method on the free market to increase customer experience. In order for customers to use self-service, companies and institutions have to provide necessary tools. Depending on the business case, different categories of DCSS are relevant. Depending on the use case, DCSS is enabled through a variety of software tools.

A chain of stores, for example, might provide DCSS tools for information which enable users to inform themselves about available products and opening hours. One tool could for example provide a search functionality for stores in the local area. Another tool could provide a catalogue of available products when a store is selected. The catalogue could also enable users to filter for relevant products.

Online retailers however will additionally require DCSS tools for transaction. This can be for example be tools for management of user profiles in order for users to authenticate and manage personal information like payment and delivery details.

As just shown, depending on the use case, complexity of technology providing DCSS can be very high. Besides enabling DCSS functionality, technology in use also needs to be maintained in order to adhere to most recent security and data protection standards. Those can also differ between countries. Therefore, in an effort to save costs or to improve functionality companies and organizations could decide to use DCSS software solutions from companies which have specialised in this area: DCSS providers.

As there exist many use cases for DCSS, different software solutions from DCSS providers are possible. The bachelor thesis focuses on DCSS providers for management of identities.

Identity management is important for many businesses and organizations. In order to provide services to individual persons it is necessary to verify their identity, access and update related information and be able to interact. Interaction and verification of identities is straight forward if somebody shows up in person. Personal information of a customer can be managed trough paper files.

DCSS providers for identity management can improve this process for customers and businesses. The following is a possible solution for identity management through DCSS providers, the bachelor thesis will assume.

\section{OZG}

This section introduces the law for improvement of online access of administrative services (Online Access Law - OZG), its origin, purpose and planned realization.

\subsection{Context}

The Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community is, amongst other things, responsible for modernizing public administration \cite{BMI:Moderne_Verwaltung}. Current modernization efforts lie in the construction of an E-Government \cite{BMI:Behoerdengaenge}.
The E-Government-Law in 2013 was an early step increasing internal usage of digital systems in governmental administration. This includes for example the usage of digital personal files and scanning of documents for replacement \cite{BMI:E-Government_Gesetz}. 
In 2017 the German government passed the law for improvement of online access to administrative services (OZG) which focuses on usage of administration services by the people \cite{BMI:Onlinezugangsgesetz}. 
Modernization of the administration, however, is not exclusive to Germany as in 2018 the European Parliament and Council decided on a Single Digital Gateway (SDG) providing uniform access to digital administrative governmental services of every European country \cite{BMI:Single_Digital_Gateway}.

\subsection{Motivation}

Customers on the free market are used to One-Stop-Shops providing access to services of companies in one digital place. Many self-service methods improve the user experience: Customers of e-commerce companies can put products in a digital shopping card, pay with digital money and select a location for delivery. In most cases, no direct human to human interaction is required. Customers complete the process of ordering in self-service. The progress of online self-service usage on the free market is a result of the ongoing digitalization of the world and the competitiveness of the market. Today, many customers own personal computers or smartphones and companies providing easy access to their services via online self-service have an advantage in the market.
Governmental institutions provide administrative services for customers. This can for example be an application for child benefit or a new ID card. In contrast to the free market, access to administrative services is, in most cases, not available through online self-service. Reasons are, that digitalization is expensive and governmental institutions do not have competitors.
Digitalization of governmental administration could for example enable users to inform themselves about available administrative services and access them over the internet. The need to personally appear in offices of an administration would be reduced. Communication about questions or required documents could also happen faster, more immediate, and more reliable over the internet than over mail. Governmental institutions could reduce bureaucracy through modernization of registries and the once-only principle.
The German government recognizes the possible improvements and presents, amongst other things, the OZG as a solution. \cite{IT-Planungsrat:Herausforderung}

\subsection{The OZG}

The law for improvement of online access of administrative services (Online Access Law - OZG) passed in 2017 and requires federal republic and member states to execute the following regulations until 2022 \cite{BMI:OZG_Wortlaut}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Digital availability of administrative services} \\
    An administrative service is the electronic processing of administrative procedures which are available from outside the governmental institution.  As it is not clear which administrative services exactly are meant by the definition of the OZG, the BMI created a catalogue \cite{BMI:Verwaltungsleistungen}. The OZG requires these services to be digitally available. As a guideline to what is considered sufficient availability, the BMI defined a maturity model \cite{BMI:Digitale_Services}.
    \item \textbf{Digital access to administrative services through administration portals of a portal network} \\
    Federal republic, each member state and each commune must provide an administration portal. Portals of communes must be linked to the portal of the corresponding member state. Portals of federal republic and member states must be connected through a portal network. \cite{BMI:Portalverbund} Each portal must provide a "seek and find" feature, which enables users to find all administrative services provided by any administration portal \cite{Cotar:Drucksache_19/19089}. 
    \item \textbf{Interoperable user profiles for accessing administrative services} \\
    Federal republic and member states must provide user profiles which can be used to identify the corresponding person while requesting access to administrative services, to save personal information according to the once-only principle, to receive and send messages via a digital mailbox and to pay for services \cite{Cotar:Drucksache_19/19089}. The user profiles must be interoperable for every administration portal of the portal network.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{OZG Execution}

Execution of the OZG can be separated into two projects: Digitalization and Networking. Digitalization focuses on transformation of existing processes and services to be using modern technologies. This includes most importantly the digitalization of governmental administrative services. The networking focuses on connecting existing and future governmental systems to make digitalization universally usable. This includes most importantly the construction of administration portals which are connected in a portal network.

Many services, which are still bound to paper must be digitalized. In total, the BMI lists 575 relevant services. Some of them are provided by the federal republic, some by the member states and yet other by the communes. Respective to these responsibilities, the task of digitalization is distributed between federal republic and member states, where each member state is assigned to take the lead for specific areas. \cite{BMI:Onlinezugangsgesetz} Results of the digitalization are documented on the "OZG-Informationsplattform" \cite{BMI:Informatiosplattform} as process diagrams and data schemata.

Administrative services are made available through administrative portals which are be provided by federal republic, each member state and each commune. Communes integrate their portals with corresponding member states. The portals are connected through an "Online-Gateway" and form a portal network.

Federal republic and each member state provide digital access to administrative services. An important method is called "one for all": One member state manages the digitalization of a category of administrative services and makes them digitally accessible for every other member state. Every administrative service can be found through a search function provided by every portal of the network.

Depending on the administrative service, a user profile is required to verify ones identity. As federal republic and most member states already provide their own user profiles, the "IT-Planungsrat" decided to save investments by connecting them to an interoperable user profile.

There exists a low, substantial and high level of authentication security when logging in to a user profile or when creating one.
A low trust level is for example the usage of a username and password combination, a high trust level is for example the usage of the eID feature of the German ID card. Depending on the administrative service a profile tries to access, a different trust level is required.

Profiles also enable users to save personal data in a data wallet and to communicate with institutions through an inbox.

\chapter{Preparatory Work}

\section{OZG DCSS Scenarios}

The information platform of the OZG contains information about many administration services in form of process diagrams \cite{BMI:Ergebnisse}. They serve as a resource to identify important DCSS scenarios of administration processes. The following scenarios were identified:

\section{DCSS Connector}

\section{OZG System Architecture}
This section describes the system architecture of a member state relevant for the execution of the OZG an integration of a DCSS provider. Due to a lack of detailed information, the system architecture is described by components responsible for a category of tasks. Each component is associated to data objects it processes. The definition of components and data objects are based on research about planned system architectures of member states.

\subsection{User Profile}
Each member state provides its own user profile which manages the identity of a user. It enables him to create, delete and login to a profile, authenticate for administration services, communicate with institutions through an inbox and manage personal information and documents in a data wallet.

\subsection{Administration Portal}
The administration portal provides the user with a web-interface he can use to access his user profile and search for available administration services.

\subsection{Application Platform}
The application platform gives access to administration services by providing the user with a website he can use to fill in application forms and sent them to the responsible institutions. It is possible to prefill the form with personal data stored inside the user profile.

\subsection{Institution}
Institutions are the entities distributed all over the member state which eventually process the incoming applications and provide the users with solutions.

\chapter{Integration Architecture}

This chapter presents a message based integration architecture which enables access to DCSS features of member states through a DCSS provider. Multiple versions of an integration architecture are presented which fulfill increasingly complex requirements. Requirements are formulated as user scenarios which should be accomplishable through the DCSS provider.
Each version is presented in the form of multiple flow charts, each describing sequential steps while carrying out a required scenario and a corresponding messaging infrastructure.

\section{Basic}

\subsection{Requirements}
In the first version of the integration architecture, users of the DCSS provider should be able to
\begin{itemize}
    \item fill in an application
    \item authenticate
    \item receive and send messages
\end{itemize}
