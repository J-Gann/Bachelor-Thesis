\chapter{Context}

The german ministry of economy and energy recognizes that "we have long since arrived in a digitized world". This realization 
of the german government comes along with important federal and european legislation. Most prominent are DSGVO, OZG and DVG, 
modernizing data protection, governmental administration and health care.

Enterprises, organizations and authorities are required to provide additional digital services for its customers and users.
Those include for example the deletion of non-mandatory data and the digital application for unemployment benefit.

Working with existing system- and data architectures, integration of new solutions is necessary.

\chapter{Objectives}

This bachelor thesis describes digital self-service as a solution for the additional requirements. It explains the basis of what 
customer self-service (CSS) is, what relevant legislation is about and how CSS providers can help in the digital transformation.

The technological challenge of integrating CSS providers into existing system architectures is focus of this bachelor thesis.
An integration architecture is presented, which provides solutions for the following questions (ToDo: In Textform schreiben):

\begin{enumerate}
     \item How can services of a CSS provider be accessed by the enterprise architecture?
     \item Which systems of a typical enterprise architecture are required?
     \item Which data objects of a typical enterprise architecture are required?
     \item Which additional systems and data objects are required?
     \item How can heterogeneous enterprise architectures be integrated the same way?
     \item How can the integration be non-invasive?
     \item How can the speed of integration development be increased?
     \item How can the speed of integration deployment be increased?
     \item How can the integration system be reliable and maintainable?
\end{enumerate}

The architecture is evaluated in respect to technological feasibility and real-life applicability. The results are incorporated into 
an operating manual, providing guidance in developing and deploying the presented integration architecture.
